# JS-Code-Quiz

## Description

This app created to demonstrate a code quiz when the user-"player" would have multiple choices to answer the questions. While picking answers the time will count down if answered incorrect then will get penalized by 10 seconds. The user will have a total of 60 seconds to finish the quiz.
